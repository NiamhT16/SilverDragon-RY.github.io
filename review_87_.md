Interest of Content:
Content is relatively interesting, with details included about several aspects of the same topic covered. Ideally, slightly more content would be provided as the information, although interesting, is relatively bare-bones. 
Very good

Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
Visual presentation is ok, some sort of padding of the 'sections' would significantly improve the users interaction with the site as the text is very far off to the left of the page. Font consistency would also be nice as the images have a different font to the text. Also the buttons are formatted differently so using the css to style them in the same way would definitely be beneficial.
Sound

Quality of written presentation
The quality of the text is high, grammar and spelling are good and the fluency is overall really good meaning that the content itself is of a good standard.
Excellent

Validity of HTML
All the HTML is valid.
Excellent

Evidence of collaboration
I am not sure if this was a group project or not, there does not seem to be any evidence of teamwork, especially as there is only one page and one piece of author information. There only seems to be one contribution so I cannot comment on 'balanced workload'; however, the functions of the site suggests that it was not completed at the last minute, which is good.
Weak
